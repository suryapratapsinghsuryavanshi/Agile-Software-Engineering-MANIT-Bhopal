# Agile-Software-Engineering-MANIT-Bhopal
This repository contains mostly all kinds of study material for M.Tech. Students in MANIT with the course of Agile Software Engineering.

Agile Software Engineering(M.Tech.) Courses are under the MBC(Mathematics, Bioinformatics & Computer Application) Department. This is a new course designed with industry-relevant subjects.

This course is under MTech. so have only four semesters divided into 2 and 2-semester coursework and industrial work, respectively. Initial 1st and 2nd semesters, you need to pursue coursework, and 3rd and 4th semesters, you can pursue the research work and thesis report, respectively.

| [Project Management in Agile](/notes/Note.md)    | PM-Agile       | Focuses on Agile methodologies for project management, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. Common frameworks include Scrum and Kanban. |
| [Software Architecture](/notes/software_arch.md)          | CS-SA          | Study of designing and structuring software systems. Involves decisions on system organization, component interactions, and patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. |
| [Humanities](/notes/english.md)                     | HUM            | Analytical study of English literature, including novels, poetry, and drama. Explores literary themes, historical contexts, and critical interpretation. |
| [Mathematics](/notes/Numerical_Analysis.md)                    | MATH           | Application of mathematical methods to solve problems involving numerical approximation and computation. Focuses on algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically. |
| [Practical Project](/notes/practical.md) | DL/ML | At the end of the First and Second semesters, you need to submit a mini report for a project in your area to showcase your learn skills during the semester. |

## Semester - 2
| Subject                        | Subject Code   | Brief Description                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Agile Software Testing](/notes/agile_software_testing.md) | SE-523 | The Testing is to be done while considering the agile methodology, which suggests testing every step of the product development cycle. |
| [DevOps Tools Chains](/notes/devops.md) | SE-522 | This is the <b>heart</b> of the entire course, which teaches the industrial work process for a huge project. On a project that may take years to complete. Where requirement rapidly changes and need to be incorporated. |
| [Data Science](/notes/ds.md) | SE-521 | Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. |
| [Data Warehousing and Data Mining](/notes/dw.md) | SE-556 | Data Warehousing is the process of collecting, storing, and managing large volumes of data from multiple sources in a centralized repository (called a data warehouse). Data Mining is the process of discovering hidden patterns, correlations, and useful information from large datasets. |
| [Research Mathodology](/notes/mth.md) | MTH-524 | Research Methodology refers to the systematic framework of techniques, methods, and procedures used to identify, collect, analyze, and interpret information in order to answer research questions or solve problems. |
| [Neural Network](/notes/nn.md) | Elective(Open) - 1 | A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems like classification, prediction, and decision-making. |
| [IOT with Cloud Computing](/notes/iot.md) | Elective - 2 | The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices, sensors, appliances, and machines that are connected to the internet and can collect, share, and act on data without requiring direct human intervention. |
