# Agile-Software-Engineering-MANIT-Bhopal
This repository contains all kinds of study material for M.Tech., Students in MANIT with the course of Agile Software Engineering.

Agile Software Engineering(M.Tech.) Courses are under the MBC(Mathematics, Bioinformatics & Computer Application) Department. This is a new course designed with new subjects that are industry-relevant.

This course is under MTech. so have only four semesters divided into 2 and 2-semester course work and industrial work respectively.

## Semester - 1
