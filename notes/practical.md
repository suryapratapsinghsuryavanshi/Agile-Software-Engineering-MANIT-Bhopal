<b>Attributes</b>: The term "attribute" is more generic and can be used to describe any property or characteristic of the data.

<b>Features</b>: Features specifically refer to the input variables used to make predictions in a machine learning model.

In machine learning, the terms "attributes" and "features" are often used interchangeably, but they can have slightly different connotations depending on the context

### CNN
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It is a type of artificial neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images or sound. CNNs are particularly effective in tasks related to computer vision, including image and video recognition, image classification, and object detection. The architecture of CNNs includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which enable the network to automatically and adaptively learn hierarchical representations of data. CNNs have been highly successful in various applications, including image and speech recognition, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicles.

Convolutional neural network is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters optimization. Vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by using regularized weights over fewer connections.

Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two sources of information to produce an output function. The term convolution refers to both the result function and the process of computing it.
