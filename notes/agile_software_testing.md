# Agile Software Testing

### What it is?
It is a study of testing techniques, tools, and practices in Agile Software Development, with a focus to test each ad every aspect of the software and ensure the quality of the software is up to the mark.

The Quality can be defined as:
- The software should be free from defects.
- The software should meet the customer requirements.
- The software should be delivered on time.
- The software should be cost-effective.
- The software should be maintainable.
- The software should be reliable, scalable, and secure.

It is:
- A continuous process.
- A collaborative effort.
- Constant Responsiveness.
- Less Documentation.
- Quick Feedback.
- Test Driven Development.

### Why it is important?
- It helps in delivering the software on time.
- It helps in delivering the software with high quality.
- It helps in delivering the software with less cost.
- It helps in delivering the software with less risk.
- It helps in delivering the software with high customer satisfaction.

### How it is done?

#### Unit Testing:
- It is a testing technique where individual units or components of the software are tested in isolation, to ensure that each unit or component is working as expected, It is done by the developers.

#### Integration Testing:
- It is a testing technique where individual units or components of the software are combined and tested together, to ensure that the integration of the units or components is working as expected, It is done by the developers.

#### System Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the entire software is tested as a whole, to ensure that the software is working as expected, It is done by the testers, it is also known as End-to-End Testing.

#### Acceptance Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested by the end-users, to ensure that the software meets the customer requirements, It is done by the end-users. It is also known as User Acceptance Testing (UAT) or Customer Acceptance Testing (CAT).

#### Regression Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested after making changes to the software, to ensure that the changes have not affected the existing functionality of the software, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Change Testing.

#### Performance Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested under different load conditions, to ensure that the software is performing as expected, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Load Testing or Stress Testing.

#### Security Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested for security vulnerabilities, to ensure that the software is secure, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Penetration Testing or Ethical Hacking. It is also known as Vulnerability Testing. It is done by the testers or security experts(Ethical Hackers).

#### Usability Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested for usability, to ensure that the software is user-friendly, It is done by the testers. It is also known as User Experience Testing.

#### Compatibility Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested on different platforms, to ensure that the software is compatible with different platforms, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Cross-Browser Testing or Cross-Platform Testing.

#### Exploratory Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested without any predefined test cases, to ensure that the software is working as expected, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Ad-hoc Testing.

#### Smoke Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested for basic functionality, to ensure that the software is working as expected, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Build Verification Testing.

#### Sanity Testing:
- It is a testing technique where the software is tested for specific functionality, to ensure that the software is working as expected, It is done by the testers. It is also known as Narrow Regression Testing.

#### Alpha Testing vs Beta Testing:
| Alpha Testing | Beta Testing |
| --- | --- |
| It is done by the developers. | It is done by the end-users. |
| It is done before the release of the software. | It is done after the release of the software. |
| It is done in the development environment. | It is done in the production environment. |
| It is done to find bugs. | It is done to find bugs and get feedback. |
| No. of test cases are less. | No. of test cases are more. |
| Done in the organization. | Done outside the organization. |
| Incress the quality of the software. | Incress the quality of the software and customer satisfaction. |

#### White Box Testing vs Black Box Testing vs Grey Box Testing:
| White Box Testing | Black Box Testing | Grey Box Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| It is done by the developers. | It is done by the testers. | It is done by the developers and testers. |
| It is done by knowing the internal structure of the software. | It is done without knowing the internal structure of the software. | It is done by knowing the partial internal structure of the software. |
| It is done by using the code. | It is done by using the requirements. | It is done by using the code and requirements. |
| Less time-consuming. | More time-consuming. | Less time-consuming. |
| Less expensive. | More expensive. | Less expensive. |
| TDD(Test Driven Development) is an example. | BDD(Behavior Driven Development) is an example. | ATDD(Acceptance Test Driven Development) is an example. |
| Code quality and code coverage are high. | Code quality and code coverage are low. | Code quality and code coverage are medium. |

#### Manual Testing vs Automation Testing:
| Manual Testing | Automation Testing |
| --- | --- |
| It is done by the testers. | It is done by the tools. |
| Much time-consuming. | Less time-consuming. |
| Much expensive. | Less expensive. |
| Test each and every time when the software is updated. | Test only once and run multiple times. |
| Less reliable. | More reliable. |
| Less accurate. | More accurate. |
| Tools: Jira, TestRail, TestLink, etc. | Tools: Selenium, Appium, JMeter, etc. |

### What is Agile Manifesto?
Agile Manifesto is a set of values and principles for Agile Software Development, which was created by a group of software developers in 2001, to improve the software development process and deliver the software on time with high quality. It is based on the following values and principles:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

#### What are the main roles in Scrum?
- <b>Product Owner:</b> The Product Owner is responsible for defining the features of the software and deciding the priority of the features.
- <b>Scrum Master:</b> The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and the team is working effectively.
- <b>Development Team:</b> The Development Team is responsible for developing the software and delivering the software on time with high quality.

#### What are the main artifacts in Scrum?
- <b>Product Backlog:</b> The Product Backlog is a list of features of the software, which are prioritized by the Product Owner.
- <b>Sprint Backlog:</b> The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks of the software, which are selected by the Development Team for the Sprint.
- <b>Increment:</b> The Increment is a working software, which is developed by the Development Team during the Sprint.

#### What are the main events in Scrum?
- <b>Sprint Planning:</b> The Sprint Planning is a meeting where the Product Owner and the Development Team decide the features of the software to be developed during the Sprint.
- <b>Daily Scrum:</b> The Daily Scrum is a meeting where the Development Team discusses the progress of the software and the tasks to be done during the day.
- <b>Sprint Review:</b> The Sprint Review is a meeting where the Product Owner and the stakeholders review the working software developed during the Sprint.
- <b>Sprint Retrospective:</b> The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting where the Development Team discusses the process of the Sprint and how to improve the process for the next Sprint.
