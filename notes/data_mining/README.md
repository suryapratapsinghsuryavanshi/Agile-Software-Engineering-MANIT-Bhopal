#### What is the difference between load and ingestion?
Data Ingestion vs Data Loading: While often used interchangeably, data ingestion encompasses the discovery, batching, and streaming of data from source systems into a data storage. Data loading, on the other hand, is the process of moving data into a specific storage layer or database.
