# Design & Thinking

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy for the end-user, collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, and a iterative process of prototyping and testing. It originated in the field of design but has since been applied to a wide range of industries and disciplines.

- Untaped Thinking
- Serve market need and develop product.

The Stanford d.school's framework of design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that involves five phases:

1. **Empathize:** This phase focuses on understanding the needs, wants, and challenges of the people you are designing for. You will conduct research, observe users in their environment, and interview them to gain a deep understanding of their experiences.

2. **Define:** Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you will define it in a clear and concise way. This will help you to focus your ideation and prototyping efforts.

3. **Ideate:** This is the most creative phase of the process, where you will brainstorm a wide range of possible solutions to the problem. You will encourage out-of-the-box thinking and defer judgment until later.

4. **Prototype:** In this phase, you will create tangible representations of your ideas. Prototypes can be low-fidelity (e.g., sketches, paper models) or high-fidelity (e.g., working prototypes). The goal is to get your ideas out of your head and into the world so that you can test them with users.

5. **Test:** This is the final phase of the process, where you will test your prototypes with users to get feedback. You will observe how they use the prototypes and ask them for their thoughts and suggestions. This feedback will help you to refine your prototypes and make them better.

The design thinking process is not always linear, and you may need to move back and forth between the phases as you work. The important thing is to be iterative and to keep testing your ideas with users.

Here are some of the key principles of Stanford d.school's design thinking framework:

* **Human-centered:** Design thinking is always focused on the needs of the people you are designing for.
* **Empathetic:** You must be able to understand and empathize with your users in order to design solutions that meet their needs.
* **Iterative:** Design thinking is not a linear process. You will need to test and refine your ideas iteratively until you come up with a solution that works.
* **Hands-on:** Design thinking is a hands-on process. You will need to create prototypes and test them with users in order to learn and iterate.
* **Collaborative:** Design thinking is best done in a collaborative environment. You should work with others to brainstorm ideas, test prototypes, and get feedback.

## Explain the roles of diffrent persons who are present in the design thinking workshop.
A design thinking workshop is a collaborative event that brings together people from different backgrounds to work on a specific problem or challenge. The goal of the workshop is to generate creative solutions that are both user-centered and feasible.

There are a number of different roles that people can play in a design thinking workshop. These roles can be broadly categorized into three groups:

* **Facilitator:** The facilitator is responsible for guiding the group through the design thinking process. They will keep the group on track, help them to generate ideas, and make sure that everyone has a chance to participate.

* **Participants:** The participants are the people who are actually doing the work of designing solutions. They will come from a variety of backgrounds, including designers, engineers, business people, and users.

* **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** SMEs are people who have expertise in a particular area that is relevant to the problem being solved. They can provide valuable insights and help the group to avoid making common mistakes.

* **Observer:** The observer is responsible for documenting the workshop process and identifying key insights. They may also provide feedback to the group and help them to reflect on their progress.


The specific roles that are needed in a design thinking workshop will vary depending on the specific problem being solved. However, the general principles are the same: the facilitator should be someone who is experienced in design thinking and has strong facilitation skills, the participants should be a diverse group of people with different perspectives, the SMEs should be experts in the relevant area, and the observer should be someone who can capture the key insights and provide feedback.

By bringing together people with different backgrounds and expertise, design thinking workshops can help to generate creative solutions that are both user-centered and feasible.

### Benefits of Design Thinking Workshops:

- **Increased creativity and innovation:** Design thinking workshops can help to break down silos and encourage people to think outside the box.

- **Improved problem-solving:** Design thinking provides a structured approach to problem-solving that can help teams to identify and solve complex problems.

- **Enhanced collaboration:** Design thinking workshops encourage collaboration and teamwork, which can lead to more effective problem-solving.

- **Better user understanding:** Design thinking emphasizes user empathy and understanding, which can lead to more user-centered solutions.

- **Increased stakeholder engagement:** Design thinking workshops can help to engage stakeholders in the design process, which can lead to more buy-in and support for solutions.

## What are the rule and guidelines that are followed for design thinking workshop.

Set Guidelines and Rules for the Workshop
The pre-call should also set expectations regarding the expected behavior of participants 
during the workshop. The facilitator should remind the sponsor that everyone should be

aware of the following rules:
- Bring an open mindset to the workshop.
- Be physically present during the workshop.
- Laptops will be turned off and other mobile devices put away (if these are not being used for note-taking) as no email or texting unrelated to the workshop should be exchanged when it takes place.
- Exercises will be timed to keep the workshop on track.
- Any discussions determined out of scope during the workshop will be noted and deferred to an appropriate time.

These guidelines and rules are sometimes repeated in an email to all participants 
prior to the workshop date. As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, they are also 
typically repeated by the facilitator at the start of the workshop.


## Explain the are of focus that an agribusiness would like to include in design thinking workshop

Design thinking can be a powerful tool for agribusinesses to address a wide range of challenges and opportunities. Here are some areas of focus that an agribusiness would like to include in a design thinking workshop:

1. **Improving farmer productivity and profitability:** Agribusinesses can use design thinking to develop new tools, technologies, and services that help farmers increase their yields, improve crop quality, and reduce their costs.

2. **Enhancing supply chain efficiency and resilience:** Design thinking can help agribusinesses identify and address inefficiencies in their supply chains, making them more responsive to market changes and disruptions.

3. **Expanding market access for smallholder farmers:** Design thinking can be used to develop innovative solutions that help smallholder farmers connect to markets, increase their bargaining power, and improve their livelihoods.

4. **Promoting sustainable agricultural practices:** Agribusinesses can use design thinking to develop sustainable agricultural practices that reduce environmental impact, conserve resources, and promote biodiversity.

5. **Enhancing consumer experience and trust:** Design thinking can help agribusinesses understand consumer needs and expectations, leading to the development of products, services, and marketing strategies that build consumer trust and loyalty.

6. **Addressing food waste and loss:** Design thinking can be used to identify and develop solutions that reduce food waste and loss throughout the food value chain, from farm to fork.

7. **Promoting food safety and quality:** Design thinking can help agribusinesses develop effective food safety and quality control systems to ensure that their products are safe and meet consumer expectations.

8. **Adapting to climate change:** Design thinking can be used to develop climate-resilient agricultural practices that help farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.

9. **Promoting social equity and inclusion:** Design thinking can help agribusinesses identify and address inequities in the agricultural sector, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to opportunities and resources.

10. **Fostering innovation and collaboration:** Design thinking can create a culture of innovation and collaboration within agribusinesses, leading to the development of new ideas and solutions.

By focusing on these areas, agribusinesses can use design thinking to address pressing challenges, create value for their stakeholders, and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable food system.

## IDEO Framework
- **Discovery:** During the discovery phase, the focus is on understanding the approach to a challenge by understanding what it is, preparing research, and gathering inspiration
- **Interpretation:** In the interpretation phase, stories are told, there is a search for meaning, and opportunities are framed.
- **Ideation:** In ideation, creation ideas are generated and refined.
- **Experimentation:** The experimentation phase consists of making prototypes and getting feedback.
- **Evoluation:** Evolution includes tracking learnings and moving forward.

## ELMO Card
- E - Enough
- L - Let's
- M - Move
- O - On

A tool that can be introduced at this time and used throughout the entire workshop is the ELMO card. These cards are useful for when discussions become too protracted and need to be deferred. Discussions that become extended and that begin to explore out-of-scope areas that are not relevant to the workshop can result in frustration among participants. As frustration grows, it is important that each participant feels empowered to suggest setting aside the discussion. In anticipation such situations, the facilitator might ask participants to write “ELMO” on an index card during this point in the workshop. The letters stand for “Enough, Let’s Move On.” This method for group focus enablement was introduced by Laurie Edwards Gray, a customer experience consultant in Atlanta. If anyone feels that the workshop is getting derailed by a discussion, they simply hold up or throw their ELMO card during the workshop. (Laurie recommends that the facilitator gently throw the first ELMO card to break the ice and show “safe” usage. Chances are that several participants, upon seeing the first card, will do the same. If they do not, the discussion should continue.) The facilitator will make note of the discussion on a whiteboard, and it will be addressed at the end of the workshop to either schedule another time to discuss and escalate or any other action the room deems relevant to the topic.

## Participant Connections
At this point, the person or their partner can be prompted to write the name and role of the person just introduced on a whiteboard. People in similar roles in the same organization are typically grouped together. Lines are then drawn to persons in different groups, and relationships are denoted among the various groups on the drawing. Such a diagram further helps to explain how the person fits in the organization.
Figure below illustrates some of the workshop participants in our supply chain optimization example and their connections. We see how the plant workers are related to IT and the data science team. The identified plant workers are users of and supported by IT. Plant workers are users of solutions developed by the data science team. The data science team helps drive specifications for the infrastructure that IT provides.

## Covert and Overt
The facilitator should be cognizant of signs of covert and overt resistance that 
might be present in some participants. Covert resistance is often expressed in negative body language, such as participants having crossed arms, pointing their index fingers, making sideways glances, gripping the table with their hands, biting fingernails and pencils, crossing legs, and kicking or fidgeting. More overt signs might include lack of participation and input during team activities.

## Inovation Ebiation Matrix
Before gathering ideas regarding how we might solve the identified problem, we might want to gage the innovation ambition tolerance within the organization. This can help workshop teams understand where they should focus when defining potential solutions. They should understand if their ideas for solutions are expected to be disruptive and highly strategic in their industry, solve an immediate crisis that is highly tactical, or span the broad spectrum. A means of classifying where solution ideas might fit is described as an innovation ambition matrix. It is described in an article published in May 2012 in the Harvard Business Review (see the Appendix for a link to the source). The matrix describes the three kinds of initiatives that organizations typically undertake as being core, adjacent, or transformational.

## Creative Matrix
The creative matrix is a tool that can be used to help workshop teams generate ideas for potential solutions. It is a simple matrix that can be used to help teams think about how they might solve the problem they are trying to address. The matrix is described in an article published in May 2012 in the Harvard Business Review (see the Appendix for a link to the source). The matrix describes the three kinds of initiatives that organizations typically undertake as being core, adjacent, or transformational.

## Value Complexity Graph
Not all solution ideas that were identified in the previous exercise should be weighted equally. That said, you might wonder how the weights should be assigned. Since it is likely that the organization is also dealing with constraints, many find that the right approach to use is balancing the anticipated value of the solution with the limited resources available to successfully develop and deploy it.

## Story Boarding[Method of Visual Thinking]
Story boarding is a method of visual thinking that can be used to help workshop teams develop a shared understanding of the problem they are trying to solve and the potential solutions they are considering. It is a simple technique that can be used to help teams think about how they might solve the problem they are trying to address. The matrix is described in an article published in May 2012 in the Harvard Business Review (see the Appendix for a link to the source). The matrix describes the three kinds of initiatives that organizations typically undertake as being core, adjacent, or transformational.

### Levels of Software Design process
- **High Level Design:** The high-level design provides an overview of the system architecture and the various components of the system and their relationships. It is usually accompanied by a high-level diagram that depicts the components and their relationships. The high-level design is usually created by the architect and reviewed by the development team.
- **Low Level Design:** The low-level design provides a detailed description of the system components and their relationships. It is usually accompanied by a low-level diagram that depicts the components and their relationships. The low-level design is usually created by the development team and reviewed by the architect.
